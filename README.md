# Page Object Model (POM) Pytest Framework

**Overview**

The Page Object Model (POM) Pytest Framework is a Python-based testing framework designed to implement the Page Object Model pattern in automated tests using Pytest.

**Description**
This project aims to provide a robust and scalable testing framework for web applications, leveraging the Pytest testing framework along with the Page Object Model design pattern.

**Features**
•	Page Object Model (POM): Organizes web elements and actions into reusable Page Object classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
•	Pytest Integration: Utilizes the Pytest framework for writing and executing test cases, allowing for powerful and flexible test automation.
•	Web Driver Management: Provides easy integration with Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web elements and performing actions on web pages.
•	Configurable: Offers flexibility through configuration options to customize test execution environments and behaviors.
•	Reporting: Generates detailed test reports with Pytest's built-in reporting capabilities, providing insights into test results and failures.
